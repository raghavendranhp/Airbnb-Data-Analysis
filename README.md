# Airbnb Analysis Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to gain valuable insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the travel and property management domain. We use MongoDB Atlas, Python scripting, data preprocessing, and Power BI for data visualization to explore the data.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Retrieval:** Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset efficiently.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Clean and prepare the dataset by addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

3. **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze and visualize pricing variations based on location and property type using Power BI.

4. **Availability Analysis:** Investigate availability patterns and occupancy rates and visualize demand fluctuations using Power BI.

5. **Location-Based Insights:** Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods, enabling users to understand location-based trends with Power BI.
